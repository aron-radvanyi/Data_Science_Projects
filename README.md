## Introduction 

This repository contains my personal Data science projects which helped me to get experience using Python and relevant data science and machine learning libraries such as pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, tenserflow, keras etc. 

## 1 Bike-Sharing Prediction Project
### 1.1 Background 
Bike-sharing systems are a new generation of traditional bike rentals where the whole process from membership, rental and return 
back has become automatic. Through these systems, the user is able to easily rent a bike from a particular position and return 
back to another place. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world which are composed of 
over 500 thousand bicycles. Today, there exists great interest in these systems due to their essential role in traffic, 
environmental and health issues. 

Apart from interesting real-world applications of bike-sharing systems, the characteristics of data being generated by
these systems make them attractive for research. Unlike other transport services such as bus or subway, the duration
of travel, departure and arrival position is explicitly recorded in these systems. This feature turns the sharing system into
a virtual sensor network that can be used for sensing mobility in the city. Hence, it is expected that the most important
events in the city could be detected by monitoring these data.

Bike-sharing rental process is highly correlated to the environmental and seasonal settings. For instance, weather conditions,
precipitation, day of week, season, hour of the day, etc. can affect the rental behaviors.

### 1.2 Main features

* Regression --> Predication of bike rental count daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings.
* Event and Anomaly Detection --> The Count of rented bikes are also correlated to some events in the town which easily are traceable via search engines.
		For instance, a query like "2012-10-30 washington d.c." in Google returns related results to Hurricane Sandy.

#### The daily bike rentals are correlated to the weather: 

* Weather 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy, Partly cloudy
* Weather 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
* Weather 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds

#### The daily bike rentals are correlated to real-temperature (temp) and feeling-temperature (atemp)

#### The correlation is visually strong

#### Most bike rentals during Summer (season 3) and weekdays Wednesday (3), Thursday (4)

### 1.3 Data
The dataset related to the two-year historical log corresponding to the years 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare system, Washington D.C., USA which is 
publicly available at http://capitalbikeshare.com/system-data. We aggregated the data on two hourly and daily basis and then 
extracted and added the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Weather information is extracted from http://www.freemeteo.com. 
The data is retrieved from: Fanaee-T, Hadi, and Gama, Joao, "Event labeling combining ensemble detectors and background knowledge", Progress in Artificial Intelligence (2013): pp. 1-15, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, doi:10.1007/s13748-013-0040-3.

## 2 Covid19 Chest X-rays image detection and classification 

### 2.1 Background 
The project applies a Deep-learning algorithm to recognise whether the patient has caught Covid or not given the X-ray image. The algorithm used for image classification is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the specific model is the VGG19.
